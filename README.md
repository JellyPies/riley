# Old Discord verification bot
riley-bot

Uses the same methods as Allie-bot, which is used in Zeeby North. Yes, I was lazy and did this in DBM. It's archived as it's been deprecated from the community so feel free to load it up. You'll find old database login information as well as Discord API info, they are all expired so if you have hostile intents let me save your time, it won't work.
